# 100 Days Of Code - Log

<!-- ### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 0: December 13, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Getting started, researched Promises to get a better understanding. I also started to build a dog photo generator page.

**Thoughts**: The first day is always the hardest to get started, but I believe I've created some starting points to achieve the goal of coding for the next 100 days.
I need to build a better understanding of the fundamentals and get more comfortable styling components myself. Here's to day 0 üçª

### Day 1: December 14, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Continuing with the Dog Generator

**Thoughts**: Glad to keep the momentum going, played around with hooking up the dog api to add pictures to the web app. I also rewrote the API request multiple times to build the muscle memory writing requests.
