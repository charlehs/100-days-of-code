# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 2: December 15, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Study session and refactored API request on dogGenerator

**Thoughts**: Started the day working through CSS grid problems, focused on getting `grid-template-areas:` into my head. I plan on doing some TS problems as well as rebuilding a component in React this afternoon.

Refactored the API request to use a utility function in dogGenerator and watched some videos on async / await functions.

### Day 1: December 14, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Continuing with the Dog Generator

**Thoughts**: Glad to keep the momentum going, played around with hooking up the dog api to add pictures to the web app. I also rewrote the API request multiple times to build the muscle memory writing requests.

### Day 0: December 13, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Getting started, researched Promises to get a better understanding. I also started to build a dog photo generator page.

**Thoughts**: The first day is always the hardest to get started, but I believe I've created some starting points to achieve the goal of coding for the next 100 days.
I need to build a better understanding of the fundamentals and get more comfortable styling components myself. Here's to day 0 üçª
