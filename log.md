### Day 5: December 18, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Dropdown parses state up

### Day 4: December 17, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Created a dropdown component that uses the checkbox component

**Thoughts**: This was a great challenge to see if I could turn my checkbox into a dropdown, I was also able to hook up the dog API to populate the list with different breeds.

### Day 3: December 16, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Worked my way through the React total typescript challenges and created a basic checkbox in the dogGenerator

**Thoughts**: Going over the Total Typescript react challenges gave me a better understanding of when to use Interface over Type. The biggest difference is that interfaces can be expanded upon whereas Type stays the same. Interface should be used mostly always but type is recommended for States. It was good learning about `React.ComponentProps<'button'>` to grab props from html elements.
<br/>
I also began to create a checkbox component in the dog app, I want to try and build it in a way it can be expanded upon.

### Day 2: December 15, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Study session and refactored API request on dogGenerator

**Thoughts**: Started the day working through CSS grid problems, focused on getting `grid-template-areas:` into my head. I plan on doing some TS problems as well as rebuilding a component in React this afternoon.
<br/>
Refactored the API request to use a utility function in dogGenerator and watched some videos on async / await functions.

### Day 1: December 14, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Continuing with the Dog Generator

**Thoughts**: Glad to keep the momentum going, played around with hooking up the dog api to add pictures to the web app. I also rewrote the API request multiple times to build the muscle memory writing requests.

### Day 0: December 13, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Getting started, researched Promises to get a better understanding. I also started to build a dog photo generator page.

**Thoughts**: The first day is always the hardest to get started, but I believe I've created some starting points to achieve the goal of coding for the next 100 days.
I need to build a better understanding of the fundamentals and get more comfortable styling components myself. Here's to day 0 üçª
